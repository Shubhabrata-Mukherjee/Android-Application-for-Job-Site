# Android-Application-for-Job-Site

It's Job site through which user can POST job and Job seeker can apply for job. On the other hand Job owner can select and reject applicaton
as well. User can create profile with his/her experience. There is vice versa review system as well.
Here is only android part which I developed.Auth0 Implementation is available here so you can get help from here. Besides, you can get help for manipulating
JSON Object/Array over different activity using localstorage. Everything I did here using Asynchttpclientrequest.
